## [Lyons Consulting Group](http://www.lyonscg.com/) (now [Capgemini North America](https://www.capgemini.com/))
##### 2014 - 2016

Completed an internship with LYONSCG, where I worked with a variety of high-end eCommerce clients, using the Demandware platform. In this position, I was fortunate enough to work on Content Management, through the Demandware Business Manager; as well as work on Front-End Development tasks; design-oriented tasks, using the Adobe Creative Suite; and administrative tasks including compiling technical documentation, formatting it to best fit the current LYONSCG branding.

### Projects -

### **[LYONSCG | Technical Documentation](https://www.lyonscg.com/)**
Beginning in January 2015, I was periodically tasked with converting developer notes into ascetically pleasing and properly branded technical documents to send to our clients.

### **[Fresh](https://www.fresh.com/)**
**Mother's Day Showcase:** Worked on development for the special Mother's Day 2015 showcase, on Fresh's website. The showcase featured 11 mothers, as well as the company's co-founder. Each mother who was chosen resides close to a brick-and-mortar Fresh store. Each mother had her own page, which included an interview and listed places where she might go for brunch, shopping, to the spa, etc. During this project, I helped set up the content on Demandware's Business Manager. [View the Mother's Day Showcase](http://www.fresh.com/MothersDayMoments.html).

**Product Discovery Quiz:** Worked on the Fresh Mask Finder Quiz for Fresh's website, for multiple locations, including: US, UK, Singapore, Hong Kong, China and South Korea. For the US, I imported questions, and their answer combinations, based upon a spreadsheet provided to us by Fresh. Also uploaded content, and did preliminary QA to make sure everything was working properly and showing up as it should. For international sites, I imported the US content, and changed it as necessary to fit the requirements of the specific country (some things included, changing the results of the quiz, and translating pages from English to Mandarin for Hong Kong and China and to Korean for South Korea). [View the Mask Finder Quiz](https://www.fresh.com/US/mask-finder/).
