**Product Discovery Quiz:** Worked on the Fresh Mask Finder Quiz for Fresh's website, for multiple locations, including: US, UK, Singapore, Hong Kong, China and South Korea.

For international sites, I imported the US content, and changed it as necessary to fit the requirements of the specific country (some things included, changing the results of the quiz, and translating pages from English to Mandarin for Hong Kong and China and to Korean for South Korea).
